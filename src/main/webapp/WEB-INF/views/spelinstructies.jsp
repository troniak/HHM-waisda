			<p>The streets at last became quiet, and the patrol, the officers of which, in their splendid costumes, 
				and surrounded by their suites, <a href="#">Passepartout</a> thought seemed like ambassadors, succeeded the bustling crowd. 
				Each time a company passed, <a href="#">Passepartout</a> chuckled, and said to himself: "Good! another Japanese embassy departing for Europe!"</p>
			
			<ul>
			
			<li>The next morning poor, jaded, famished <a href="#">Passepartout</a> said to himself that he must get something to eat at all hazards, 
				and the sooner he did so the better. </li>
				
			<li>He might, indeed, sell his watch; but he would have starved first. Now or never he must use the strong, if not melodious voice which nature had bestowed upon him.</li>
			<li>He knew several French and English songs, and resolved to try them upon the Japanese, who must be lovers of music, since they were for ever pounding on their cymbals, 
				tam-tams, and tambourines, and could not but appreciate European talent.</li>

			<li>It was, perhaps, rather early in the morning to get up a concert, and the audience prematurely aroused from their slumbers, might not possibly pay their entertainer with coin bearing the Mikado's features.</li>
			<li>Passepartout therefore decided to wait several hours; and, as he was sauntering along, it occurred to him that he would seem rather too well dressed for a wandering artist.</li>
			<li>The idea struck him to change his garments for clothes more in harmony with his project; 
					by which he might also get a little money to satisfy the immediate cravings of hunger. 
					The resolution taken, it remained to carry it out.</li>

			<li>It was but too true that the railway came to a termination at this point.</li> 
			<li>The papers were like some watches, which have a way of getting too fast, and had been premature in their announcement of the completion of the line.</li>
			<li>The greater part of the travellers were aware of this interruption, and, leaving the train, 
				they began to engage such vehicles as the village could provide:
				<ul>
					<li><img src="/static/img/match-pioneer.png" alt="" /> four-wheeled palkigharis</li>
					<li><img src="/static/img/match-social.png" alt="" /> waggons drawn by zebus</li>
					<li><img src="/static/img/match-social.png" alt="" /> carriages that looked like perambulating pagodas,</li>
					<li><img src="/static/img/match-pioneer.png" alt="" /> palanquins, ponies, and what not</li>

			<h3>Subheader h3</h3>
			
			<p>'I know what "it" means well enough, when I find a thing,' said the Duck: 'it's generally a frog or a worm. The question is, what did the archbishop find?'</p>

			<p>The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, '"—found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him the crown. William's conduct at first was moderate. But the insolence of his Normans—" How are you getting on now, my dear?' it continued, turning to Alice as it spoke.</p>
